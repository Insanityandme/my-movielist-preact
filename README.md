# My Movielist - Preact + Vite

This project uses Preact and Vite using the initializer `create-preact`
using the command `npm init preact`

I wanted to try a smaller version of react that fits my needs more nicely instead of a big framework and
Preact is really good for that. Also wanted to skip build steps but I still used it to be able to use JSX.

I still feel like there are a lot of moving parts for such a small project and components and would personally
just do the whole thing in one big component so that I don't have to pass props everywhere but still wanted
to give it a try!
